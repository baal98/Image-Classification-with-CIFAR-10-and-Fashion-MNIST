## Project Highlights

Throughout this project, I've embarked on a journey of research, exploration, and analysis. Some of the project's highlights include:

- Leveraging techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).
- Thorough analysis, visualization, and interpretation of the CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST datasets.
- Investigating anomaly detection in the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Preparing, modeling, training, and testing machine learning models.
- Drawing insights and conclusions from a wealth of visualizations and experiments.
